<li>Create a reading timetable.</li><br>

to forgeting to give yourself breaks where you can rest or relax your brain.</p><br>
<li>Read at the sametime everyday.</li><br>

You will become mentally and emotionally more prepared for each study session<br>
making you more productive and efficient.</p><br>

<p id="skills">Just studying for the sake of it leads you nowhere.You need to set<br>
for yourself clear goals that you can achieve per study session.<br>
e.g know all the types of families in heritage studies.</p><br>
<li>DO NOT try to cram all topics or subject areas in one study session.</li><br>
<p id="skills">Do not try to do all the stuff at the same time , you not a machine.<br>
You should not keep up long hours while studying , trust me that most<br>
of the information will be gone when you fall asleep.<br> As stated <br>
you should have a timetable to this.</p><br>
<li>Have a conducive study area of your own.</li>
<p id="skills">Study somewhere you know you will not be distracted or disturbed.<br>
Somewhere there is no too much noise pollution. You can even change<br> 
environments per study session to help the brain be able to differentiate<br>
the information gained at different intervals. You study area should be <br>
as comfortable as possible.</p><br>
<li>Always review your notes before starting a task/assignment.</li><br>
<p id="skills">Almost all Zimbabwean government schools are given notes in class<br>
make it a point to look at them first before you can embark on a<br>
given task or assignment.This will help you remember important<br>
topical points.</p><br>
<li>Join study groups.</li><br>
<p id="skills">Working in groups helps a lot. When you study in groups you <br>
are able to share ideas. If one of you have any misconception on<br>
a specific idea or topic , you able to correct each other.You<br>
can also help each other complete tasks or assignments more <br>
quickly.</p></ol><br>

new ones are added. So by studying past exam papers and understanding<br>
them , you guarantee yourself of passing your exam.</p><br>
