<h1>Global issues</h1>
<h3>Land degradation</h3>
<p>It is the loss of value of a piece of land dure<br>
to soil erosion , urbanisation , human activities ,overgrazing,<br>
river siltation or defforestation.Increased demand for agricultue<br>
products also is a major contribution to land degradation as large<br>
tracts of land are cleared to accomodate it.</p>
<h3>Causes of Land degradation</h3>
<p id="head"><b>Agriculture</b></p>
<p>When land is cleared for agriculture a lot<br>
happens.The organisms that were in the natural environment<br>
are lost. Land is left bare at some point , making erosion<br>
by wind and rain possible.</p>
<p id="head"><b>Defforestation</b></p>
<p>The trees help bind soil together. When they are removed<br>
the soil is loosened making soil erosion possible. This soil can <br>
swept into rivers causing river siltation.</p>
<p id="head"><b>Overgrazing</b></p>
<p>This is wereby cattle is left to graze aimlessly<br>
without close supervision making it graze all/allmost <br>
the pastureland available.This has the effect of causing <br>
soil erosion as lan is left bare.This also reduces the ability<br>
of plants to grow or water to penetrate the soil.</p> 
<p id="head"><b>Riverbank Cultivation</b></p>
<p>This has the effect of blocking up rivers or <br>
water sources commonly known as river siltation.<br>
Aquatic life can be affected by this and can kill<br>
it. Some chemicals can even find their way into <br>
the rivers.</p>
<p id="head"><b>Mining activities</b></p>
<p>Mining has the effect of first causing defforestation<br>
in the act destroying natural ecosystems.Destroying of<br>
organisms and blockage of any river sources in the area.</p>
<h3>Effects of land degradation</h3>
<p id="head"><b>Desertification</b></p>
<p>Desertification can be described as a climate condition<br>
that has frequent droughts , low to zero rainfall , dry spells and<br>
above all hot temperatures during the day and cold during nights.<br>
The effects of this include loss of biodiversity ,land degradation and<br>
soil erosion among other things.</p>
<p id="head"><b>Loss of arable land</b></p>
<p>Arable land is land that can be used to grow crops.<br>
With the washing away of top soil i.e soil erosion the soil<br>
left is not suitable for crop cultivation. Other activities<br>
such as mining also cause loss of soil arability.</p>
<p id="head"><b>Destruction of natural ecosystems</b></p>
<p>With the rapid growing population , alot of land is<br>
cleared to make room for human settlement or agricultural<br>
development.Organisms or other life forms are also cleared or<br>
in the process.</p>
<p id="head"><b>River siltation or blockage of waterways</b></p>
<p>River bank cultivation of plants makes soil and chemicals<br>
flow into the waterways making the rivers be blocked.Also mining<br>
of minerals close to waterways blocks them and adds harnmful<br>
chemicals.Industries that dump solid wastes in the waterways also<br>
face risk of contaminating and blocking waterways.</p>
<p id="head"><b>Risk of flooding</b></p>
<p>With the convection of floodplains or wetlands into agricutural<br>
or residential areas , risk of flooding is met.The lands will not <br>
be able to absorb water as before .</p> 
<h3>Mitigation against Land degradation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inforcement of legislation against streambank cultivation.</li>
<li>Creation of a policy that makes it compulsory for a mine<br>
to rehabilitate the area it mined on after its operations have ceased.</li>
<li>No cultivation policy on wetlands or floodlains.</li>
<li>Creation of paddocks in a effort to control overgrazing.</li>
<li>Creation of Afforestation programmes</li>
</ul>
<h1>Pollution</h1>
<h3>Types of pollution</h3>
<ol>
<li>Water pollution</li>
<li>Air pollution</li>
<li>Land pollution</li>
<li>Noise pollution</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li id="head2"><b>Water pollution</b></li>
<p>Water pollution is when water sources are contaminated.<br>
Various aquatic organisms depend on these waters so if they got<br>
contaminated they might die involving us humans who also depend on<br>
on these waters.</p>
<p id="polluttion"><b>Causes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Industrial waste dumped by in water sources creates an 
environment that is not chemically conducive for some animals</li>
<li>Fertilizers , pesticides e.t.c used by farmers may find their 
way into water sources or rivers ending up killing fish or other 
animals that depend on these waters.</li>
<li>Bathing or using the river as a toilet or bathing in rivers leaves 
chemicals in the river and makes the water be diseased so that if someone
done the river uses this water might get sick.</li>
<li>Oil leaks of tanks at sea causes the pollution fo the water.</li>
</ul>
<p id="pollution"><b>Mitigation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Regulation against dumping untreated chemicals into water sources</li>
<li>Water treatment plants should be built to help reduce the pollution 
already incurred.</li>
<li>Preventation of bathing in rivers e.t.c and using proper facilities.</li>
</ul>
<li id="head2"><b>Air pollution</b></li>
<p>The contamination of the atmosphere is called air pollution.<br>
All organisms respire using the air around them , so if it gets<br>
contaminated some drastic effects can be witnessed. Air needs<br>
to be clean and free from poisonous gases all the time.</p>
<p id="pollution">Causes</p>
<ul>
<li>Exhaust gases from vehicles that are not fully combusted.</li>
<li>Some industries which produce gases like sulphur dioxide and
carbon monoxide which mix the air and clouds to form acid rain.</li>
<li>Burning of fossil fuels and other plastics produces some
harmful gases.</li>
</ul>
<p id="pollution">Mitigation</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of catalytic converters in vehicles .</li>
<li>Preventing the burning of used products</li>
<li>Development of a method to rid of gases
produced by industries.</li>
</ul>
<li id="head2"><b>Land pollution</b></li>
<p>Each household produces tonnes of garbage each<br>
year. Garbage like aluminium, plastic, paper, cloth,<br>
wood is collected and sent to the local recycling unit.<br>
Items that can not be recycled become a part of the <br>
landfills that hampers the beauty of the city and cause<br>
land pollution.</p>
<p id="pollution">Causes</p>
<ul>
<li>Solid waste from homes, restaraunts, public places,
markets, offices, and so on. Because most of these waste
materials are non-biodegradable they heap in the landfills 
where they stay for years.</li>
<li>Agricultural waste from animal manure, crop and farm remains.
The solid wastes like the animal manure and other agricultural by
products are collected and dumped in the landfills.</li>
<li>Industrial processes, construction activities and power 
plants produce a wide range of solid by-products and residues.
The predominant waste products are generated from oil refineries,
 power plants, construction works, pharmaceuticalsnand so on.</li>
<li>Poor enforcement of legislation against littering.</li>
<li>Inadequate dumping places</li>
<li>Uncollection of wastes</li>
<li>Rapid population growth without adequate city planning.</li>
</ul>
<p id="pollution">Mitigation</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and implementation of intergrated waste management
system.</li>
<li>Enforcement of existing legislation against waste management.</li>
<li>Collection and clean up of existing overcrowded landfills.</li>
<li>Improvement of the existing collection system of wastes.</li>
<li>Proactive city planning by city fathers to cater for the rapidly
growing population.</li>
