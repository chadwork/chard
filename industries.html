<h2>Land ownership in Zimbabwe</h2>
<h3>Laws governing land ownership in Zimbabwe<br>
during the colonial era.</h3>
<p>During the colonial era alot of laws were passed<br>
in a bid to distribute land between the blacks and whites.<br>
Whereby the whites got the best land and the blacks were<br>
to starve in the dry , unproductive reservese.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>The Lippert Concession(1889)</b></li>
<p>This was one of the treaties that was in the forefront of<br>
colonisation.This treaty was made between lobengula and the<br>
Germans but latter bought by the British which gave the <br>
right to use Lobengula`s land in anyway he liked.</p>
<li><b>The Native Reserves Order in Council(1898)</b></li>
<p>This was one of the most discriminating law passed against<br>
the blacks. This law created what were known as reserves<br>
for the blocks. This reserves were situated in areas that <br>
were dry and unproductive.On the other hand whilst the blacks<br>
were crowded in the reserves , whites got the eleplant`s share<br>
of the land. Their was fertile and got large amounts of rain<br>
neccessary for agriculture production.</p>
<li><b>The Land Apportionment Act(1930)</b></li>
<p>Its purpose was to formalise the separation of land<br>
by law. This was done just after the reccomendations of the<br>
Morris Carter commission of 1925.The population of the country consisted
of 1.1million Africans and 50 000 Whites.It was divided as follows:<br>
Forest 3 000 000acres<br>
Native Purchase areas 8 000 000acres<br>
Native Reserves 29 000 000acres<br>
Unassigned 6 000 000acres</p> 
<li><b>Native Land Husbandry Act(1951)</b></li>
<p>This gave black Africans the right to apply for formal<br>
title deeds yo specific tracts of land.This act was hard to<br>
implement so in the 1960s Lan Smith`s administration removed<br>
it.</p>
<li><b>The Tribal Trust Lands(TTL)act(1965)</b></li>
<p>It divides into fve regions in which the first three<br>
were reserved for white settlers and the remaining two<br>
for the blacks.<br>This created problems such as that: <br>
Some of the white owned land was left lying idle bacause<br>
of the few population(under-utilization) whilst the black<br>
owned land became overworked bacause of the vast population <br>
on the small piece of land.</p>
<li><b>The Land Tenure act(1969)</b></li>
<p>This tried to amend the land apportionment act by giving more<br>
land to the blacks about 45 million acres from the White settlers but<br>
they continued to own the fertile lands in Region 1,2 and 3.</p>
</ol>
<h3>How colonial laws on land affected the indigenous<br>
people</h3>
<ul>
<li>There were displaced from their native lands.</li>
<li>Cultural method of survival were aborted.</li>
<li>Families were broken</li>
<li>Sarted the migration to towns in search<br>
of work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Measures taken by governments to<br>
redistribute land since 1980</h3>
<p>A number of laws were passed to support or<br>
impower the black majority.Just before independence</br>
a number of rules or regulations were passed on how<br>
there were the new government was going to do this.<br>
One of the prominent agreements was that land was to<br>
be acquired from the whites on a willing buyer/seller basis.<br>
The British government would provide half the cost.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The communal land act(1981)</b></li>
<p>It was an act designed to change the TTLs into communal<br>
areas from being reserves. This started to be led by local<br>
authourities taking over power from the Traditional leaders.</p> 
<li><b>The Land Acquisition Act(1985)</b></li></ul>
<p>It gave the government the right to purchase land from the<br>
large scale white commercial farmers . It made it possible to<br>
redistribute the land among the black native peasants.</p>
<h3>The Land Reform Programmes</h3>
<h4>The First Phase of land reform</h4>
<p><b>Aims of the land reform</b></p>
<ol>
<li>To give land to the landless.</li>
<li>To relieve population pressure on overcrowded areas</li>
<li>To reduce poverty in drought stricken areas.</li>
<li>To utilize idle or underused land into full production.</li>
<li>To give/reward war veterans.</li>
<li>To correct the colonial imbalance of land between the<br>
blacks and whites.</li>
</ol>
<p>It composed of two models , the Model A1 and the Model A2.<br>
The Model A1 composed of villagised areas . Each was given a <br>
a residential area plus a arable plot where he/she could farm.<br>
The residential area was separated from the plots.</p>
<p>The Model A2 consisted of self contained plots due to<br>
subdivision of former white large-scale commercial farms.<br>
The blacks had to use the existing infastructures such as<br>
roads , clinics e.t.c . The existing workers compounds were to be<br>
 left and the tendents could offer their labour if they wanted.The <br>
could no assistance from the government he had to establish other things
on his own such as houses e.t.c</p>
<h4>The Second phase<h4>
<p>Also known as the fast track land reform programme or Jambaja<br>
Hondo yeMinda.This was not organised people just started walking
into White owned farms without any permission.This spread the whole
country and white farmers were displaced from their farms.It started
first at Svosvi village where they attacked the nearby farm.</p>
<h3>Challenges encountered with the LRP and FTLRP</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lack of capital to start intensive farming</li>
<li>Underutilization of allocated land.</li>
<li>Inadequate infrastructure such as roads , clinics e.t.c</li>
<li>Resource depletion through unsustainable use of land.</li>
<li>Corrupt practices in land allocation and poor management.</li>
<li>The FTLRP led to bad global publicity.</li>
<li>A lack of title deeds inhibited developments and investing<br>
in the land.</li>
<li>Multiple farm ownership</li>
</ul>
<h3>Possible solutions to some of the challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provision of capital from the AGRIBANK.</li>
<li>Use of AREX officers to educate on good<br>
farming methods.</li>
<li>Control of corruption in land allocation.</li>
<li>Carrying out land audits to minimize underutilization<br>
of land.</li>
<li>Prosecution to multiple farm owners.</li>
</ul>
<article>
<h1 class="informal">Constraints to the Informal sector</h1>
<ol id="list">
<li>Lack of capital</li>
<p id="informal">Loans are generally hard to come by for the informal sector.<br>
The informal sector offers uncertainty and high risk to banking <br>
institutions of ever paying back.Lack of regulatory framework that can be<br>
used by bank to access risk.</p>
<li>Credit lines</li>
<p id="informal">These businesses lack the legal rights to operate,<br>
so are unable to access public services or formal services <br>
of credit.Lack of transparency in their operation makes<br>
the banks reluctant to lend them money.Failure to maintain<br>
proper books of accounts.</p>
<li>Skills</li>
<p id="informal">Some members of the informal sector lack the required<br>
entrepreneur skills or business skills to neccessary build<br>
their business. Some do not even have the accounting skills<br>
to know if their making a profit or not.</p>
<li>Insurance</li>
<p id="informal">Informal sector businesses can not be ensured as they not<br>
legal tenders . So in case of theft , robbery or net loss no <br>
insurance plan will cover for them.</p>
<li>Sanctions</li>
<p id="informal">Cause the growth of informal sector activities as they<br>
inhibit normal formal business to occur. People are forced to<br>
involve themselves in border jumping , black markets and other<br>
activities to earn something.</p>
<li>Policy framework</li>
<p id="informal">Rules and Regulation of the country do not support <br>
the informal sector. So this inhibit meanful progress to<br>
be made in the business.</p>
<li>There is no continueity of the business</li>
<p id="informal">Due to many factors such as lack of funds,<br>
death of founder the business may discontinue its<br>
operations for some time.</p>
<li>lack of working equipment</li>
<p id="informal">The workers are forced to improvise with adage<br>
equipment and some have none at all. This inhibits<br>
the business to grow or make meaningful progress.</p>
<li>The working conditions are bad for the workers.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Possible solutions</h3>
<ul id="list">
<li>Opening credit lines for small and medium <br>
enterprises and recapitalise the economy.</li>
<li>Restoring investor confidence back so that<br>
there will be continuous flow of Foreign Direct Investment.</li>
<li>Control of corruption in the existing businesses.</li>
<li>Settling of all outstanding debts with the international community</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship skills should be developed.</li>
<li>Should attract the government to make favourable policies to the informal sector.</li>
<li>Opening up of vocational colleges so that they obtain the neccessary skills <br>
for business.</li>
<li>The informal sector participants should be incouraged to register their<br>
businesses.</li>
<li>The informal sector incollaboration with the government should create <br>
convinient places of work.</li>
<li>The informal sector should improve its working conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="reserve">National Strategic Reserves</h1>
<h3>Lists of strategic reserves in Zimbabwe</h3>
<ol id="reserve">
<li>Grain Marketing Board</li>
<p id="national">Allows the country to maintain food security in the<br>
country. The GMB silos store grain during the agriculture<br>
season. Then after the Agriculture season the collected grain can<br>
 then be dispersed across the country and if there is surplus ,<br>
it is exported to other countries.</p>
<li>Selling and distribution of minerals e.g Diamonds</li>
<p id="national">The mining and selling of minerals such as Diamond and<br>
Platinum is considered to be strategic. If people just mine and<br>
plunder this resources they might run out and the further generations<br>
 won`t have any.So its selling and distribution should be strictly<br>
controlled and looked after.</p> 
<li>National wildlife reserves</li>
<p id="national">The animals in the national parks such as elephants, rhinos e.t.c<br>
are supposed to be looked after. This animals are part of the heritage <br>

People cannot just kill or sell these as they are very important to the
country.</p>
<li>National Historic Monuments</li>
<p id="national">Areas such as Great Zimbabwe , Victoria Falls and Dhlodhlo ruins are<br>
places of national history and heritage that should be preserved for<br>
further generations. This places are also used for tourism and as a <br>
reminder of our culture and national heritage that we should all keep<br>
and protect.</p>
<li>Water body reserves e.g Kariba Dam</li>
<p id="national">Water bodies such as Zambezi river , Sebakwe river and many others<br>
are kept and protected as they provide life for animals and us also.<br>
The water is also used in industries , domestic use , production of electricity,<br>
tourism and fishing among other things.This are very important reserves of <br>
Zimbabwe and used be kept for future generations to use also or benefit from them.</p>
<li>National strategic industries e.g BATA</li>
<p id="national">Companies such as BATA and NRZ(National Railways of Zimbabwe) are strategic
companies of Zimbabwe that should be taken care of as they earn foreign currency
for the country.This companies belong to the country therefore invest their resources 
in us the Zimbabweans in terms of Jobs , social services , vocational training 
among others.</p>
